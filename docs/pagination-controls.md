## Overview

If enabled, pagination controls, or "pagers", are dynamically generated, added and removed based on the current filter, sort, page limit and page number.

An empty element with the class `pager-list` should be added to your markup where you want your controls to be. Pagination buttons will be generated inside this container.</p>
